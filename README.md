# instructions

This is a standard react app with start script `npm start`.

# purpose

Most package managers do not care what order your files are zipped in.
However, package submission processes (like Microsoft Teams Integrations)
require that your package is zipped in a certain order. Windows OS allows
you to zip files in a specified order but macOS does not. This is a simple
web app that allows you to upload files, drag and drop into a specific
order, and zip your files in the specified order.
